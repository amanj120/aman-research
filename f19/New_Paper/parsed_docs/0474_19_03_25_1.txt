  part i: describe russian interference document crimes associated with it and determine if any americans were involved .  this section notes the trump campaign did not knowingly conspire or coordinate with russia in its interference efforts . 
  part ii: address obstruction of justice concerns related to a number of  primarily public  actions by president trump .  the report presented evidence  considering both sides  but did not draw a conclusion on the matter leaving the decision to the ag who determined there was not sufficient evidence to constitute a crime .
