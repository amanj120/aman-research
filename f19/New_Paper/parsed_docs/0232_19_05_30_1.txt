robert muellers statement yesterday largely reiterated already public information related to his investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election .  while he directly stated the report speaks for itself mueller highlighted several key points during his remarks including:
  the report does not clear president trump of obstruction: if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so . 
  the report does not determine president trump obstructed justice: we did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime . 
  any further onus is on congress: the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing .
