the first 2020 democratic presidential debate kicked off yesterday in part one of the two night debate .  here are key takeaways :
  emergent themes included the economy and general consensus that it is working for large corporations but not for working people; healthcare and differing views on overhauling private insurance; immigration and stark differences on an effective policy approach; appealing to a diverse base including three candidates speaking spanish . 
  candidates were light on personal attacks and avoided criticism of top polling candidates like joe biden and bernie sanders . 
  despite no major breakout moments julian castro is being noted particularly for his performance on immigration policy and elizabeth warren for effectively defending her territory .
